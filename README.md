              HOUSE PRICE PREDICTION PROJECT
This GitHub repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (house-price-prediction.ipynb) for analyzing and predicting house prices using the Boston Housing Dataset. The project is implemented in Python, leveraging libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, and XGBoo
            Overview
 Objectives
Data Collection and Preprocessing: Fetch and prepare the dataset.
Data Analysis and Visualization: Gain insights through visualizations.
Model Building and Training: Develop multiple regression models.
Model Evaluation and Feature Importance: Assess model performance and analyze feature importance.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Jupyter Notebook
Python 3.6+
Install required packages:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/house-price-prediction.git
cd house-price-prediction
Launch Jupyter Notebook and open house-price-prediction.ipynb.
Dataset
The project uses the Boston Housing Dataset from Kaggle, which includes 14 features (e.g., crime rate, room count, pupil-teacher ratio) to predict the median value of owner-occupied homes (MEDV).

Notebook Structure
Data Collection: Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
Data Preprocessing: Handle missing data and standardize features.
Data Analysis: Visualize data and analyze correlations.
Model Building and Evaluation: Train and evaluate models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Extra Trees, XGBoost) using Mean Squared Error and cross-validation.
Model Performance
The Jupyter Notebook includes performance metrics and feature importance analysis, revealing which factors most influence house price predictions.
